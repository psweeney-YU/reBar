USAGE OSX & LINUX

1. Modify variables in reBar.pl as described in INSTALLATION.txt.
2. Open a Terminal.
3. Change into directory containing files (cd /User/joe/images/)
4. Run the perl script by typing reBar.pl at the prompt. You may need to supply the path to the script, if it is not in your $PATH environment variable.

After script is finished running:
Renamed files will be copied to a new directory ("renamed_date+time") within the directory containing the original files. The original files are not deleted. In the directory containing the original image files, a log file will be created (csv formatted) reporting success or failure for each file.

Depending on your hardware, it can take a few seconds (5 seconds on tested system) for a single 12 MB jpg file to be OCR'd and for the jpg and archival file to be copied. If multiple barcodes are in the original image (i.e., multiple barcodes on a sheet), a separate jpg image and dng image will be created for each barcode/specimen (this logic assumes one barcode per specimen).
