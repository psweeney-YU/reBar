reBar.pl vers. 0.9

Execution of reBar.pl will loop through JPEG files in a directory, use ZBar (http://zbar.sourceforge.net/) to find barcode in JPEG file, and then copy the JPEG and corresponding archival file (e.g., a DNG) to new folder, using the found barcode value as the filename.

The script assumes image directory will have JPEGs and an archival file of a different format, both with the same original name (minus the extension). An expectation is that the barcodes will contain data typical of that found in natural history specimen barcodes (i.e., a collection code plus a locally unique number - 'ABC12345678').

Renamed files will be copied to a new directory ("renamed_date+time") within the directory containing the original files. The original files are not deleted. In the directory containing the original image files, a log file will be created (csv formatted) reporting success or failure for each file.

If multiple barcodes are in the original image (i.e., multiple barcodes on a sheet), a separate JPEG image and archival image will be created for each barcode/specimen (this logic assumes one barcode per specimen). 

*****************************
USAGE ON WINDOWS

1. Modify variables in reBar.pl as described in INSTALLATION.txt.
2. Open Command Prompt window or PowerShell.
3. Change into directory containing files (chdir "C:\path\to\image\files").
4. Run script (perl "C:\path\to\script\reBar.pl").


*****************************
USAGE OSX & LINUX

1. Modify variables in reBar.pl as described in INSTALLATION.txt.
2. Open a Terminal.
3. Change into directory containing files (cd /User/joe/images/)
4. Run the perl script by typing reBar.pl at the prompt. You may need to supply the path to the script, if it is not in your $PATH environment variable.

After script is finished running:
Renamed files will be copied to a new directory ("renamed_date+time") within the directory containing the original files. The original files are not deleted. In the directory containing the original image files, a log file will be created (csv formatted) reporting success or failure for each file.

Depending on your hardware, it can take a few seconds (5 seconds on tested system) for a single 12 MB jpg file to be OCR'd and for the jpg and archival file to be copied. If multiple barcodes are in the original image (i.e., multiple barcodes on a sheet), a separate jpg image and dng image will be created for each barcode/specimen (this logic assumes one barcode per specimen).
